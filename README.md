# <center> About Me </center>

My name is Nivi Achanta and I'm graduating UC Davis in 2017 with a degree in statistics and another one in managerial economics. During my time at Davis, I have helped found and grow two campus organizations: [Consult Your Community Davis](http://cycdavis.com) and [Net Impact Davis](http://netimpactdavis.com). CYC Davis is a chapter of a national undergraduate consulting group that offers pro-bono services to local businesses in the Davis area, and Net Impact is the undergraduate chapter of an [international non-profit](http://netimpact.org) that I founded in October 2016. Please feel free to check out the websites to see what my teams and I have been working on over the years. 

I will be working full-time in San Francisco as a consultant starting in Fall 2017, and ultimately, my goal is to fix America's education system. I have been working on an econometrics thesis, which you can find [here eventually](coming soon!). 

In my free time, I win case competitions, hang out with my friends, go rock climbing, and read as many books as I possibly can without my eyes hurting. I am also a connoisseur of Trader Joe's cheese and budget wine. 

Please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/niviachanta) and check out my [résumé](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwp1-hdDHOYXWkNaS0hjenROWkk/view?usp=sharing)!

# <center> Consult Your Community (CYC) Davis
I have been with CYC since its first engagement cycle in 2013. I was promoted from a consultant to an engagement manager to the Vice President of Internal Affairs, which has been my role for the 2016-2017 school year. Once we hired a new executive board for the 2017-2018 board, I took on consultant responsibilities once again, and web scraped the Davis Chamber of Commerce website to put together a list of all the businesses in Davis and its surrounding areas. You can find my code [here](Davis_Chamber_Code.html) and the actual spreadsheet below.

# <center> Case Competitions </center>
During my time at UC Davis, I have been a finalist in over 7 business case competitions. The most well known one is the PwC Challenge case competition, and during its début at UC Davis, my team and I (team Davis Women in Business) won first place. After the PwC victory, we participated in a case competition sponsored by Target in 2017, winning second place. Both cases involved a PowerPoint presentation and a write-up. To give you a good representation of my work, I've attached the written deliverable for PwC's Challenge, and the PowerPoint for Target.
