# <center> About Me </center>

My name is Nivi Achanta and I'm graduating UC Davis in 2017 with a degree in statistics and another one in managerial economics. During my time at Davis, I have helped found and grow two campus organizations: [Consult Your Community Davis](http://cycdavis.com) and [Net Impact Davis](http://netimpactdavis.com). CYC Davis is a chapter of a national undergraduate consulting group that offers pro-bono services to local businesses in the Davis area, and Net Impact is the undergraduate chapter of an [international non-profit](http://netimpact.org) that I founded in October 2016. Please feel free to check out the websites to see what my teams and I have been working on over the years. 

I will be working full-time in San Francisco as a consultant starting in Fall 2017, and ultimately, my goal is to fix America's education system. I have been working on an econometrics thesis, which you can find [here eventually](coming soon!). 

In my free time, I win case competitions, hang out with my friends, go rock climbing, and read as many books as I possibly can without my eyes hurting. I am also a connoisseur of Trader Joe's cheese and budget wine. 

Please feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/niviachanta) and check out my [résumé](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bwp1-hdDHOYXWkNaS0hjenROWkk/view?usp=sharing)!
